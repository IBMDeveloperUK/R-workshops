# R-workshops
Some introductory R notebooks for Jupyter and RStudio in the Watson Studio environment.

Thhere are lots of samples available for python notebooks for Jupyter, and hence for Watson Studio; Here, you will find a selection of similar notebooks, but which use the R runtime environment, instead of Python. 

Half of the notebooks are intended for experimenting with the R language in a Jupyter environment, the rest should be explored using RStudio.

Check out [python pandas workshop](https://github.com/IBMDeveloperUK/python-pandas-workshop) for details of creating a Watson Studio instance.

## RStudio overview

A taster of RStudio - it's a full-blown Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the R language.

[Try it out](/rstudio/README.md)

## Baby steps

To get you going, and feeling comfortable with the R language, and show it's not too far away from Python, we'll try some simple statements, and explore data structures. 

Then we can try out programming consructs, error handling and building functions.

To tie it together, we can tackle a bit of data visualisation with plotting and charting, as well as mapping with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) and [Leaflet for R].

## Making apps - Shiny

RStudio provides a mechanism for taking your R code and publishing as a web application - this is based around the **Shiny** application framework.

Shiny makes it relatively easy to convert data exploration tasks and visualisations into interactive web apps.

let's take a look a building your own *Hello World* with RStudio and Shiny.
