Welcome to a small but growing set of workshops and briefings around the use of R language and RStudio within the IBM Cloud environment, using Watson Studio.

+ [A gentle introduction to R and Rstudio](README-Intro-RStudio.md) - June 2020
+ [Introducing Machine Learning with R](README-ML-RStudio.md) - July 2020

If you'd like to try the hands-on activities, you'll need an IBM Cloud account which you can create here [http://ibm.biz/mlrstudio](http://ibm.biz/mlrstudio)

If you already have an IBM Cloud account, login from https://cloud.ibm.com to get your cloud console/dashboard.

After that create or access your Watson Studio instance.
