title: "R Notebook for Leaflet maps"

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# load packages
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(rjson)
library(jsonlite)
library(leaflet)
library(RCurl)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
map_r_birthplace <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # use the default base map which is OpenStreetMap tiles
  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852,
             popup="The birthplace of R")
map_r_birthplace
```
Letâ€™s create your own interactive map of surface water data. To do this, you will follow the steps below:

1. Request and get the data from the colorado.gov SODA API in R using fromJSON().
1. Address column data types to ensure your quantitative data (number values) data are in fact numeric.
1. Remove NA (missing data) values.

Check out [EarthDataScience](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/get-data-using-apis/leaflet-r/) for more extensive leaflet mapping
```{r}
base_url <- "https://data.colorado.gov/resource/j5pc-4t32.json?"
full_url <- paste0(base_url, "station_status=Active",
            "&county=BOULDER")
water_data <- getURL(URLencode(full_url))

# you can then pipe this
water_data_df <- fromJSON(water_data) %>%
  flatten(recursive = TRUE) # remove the nested data frame

# turn columns to numeric and remove NA values
water_data_df <- water_data_df %>%
  mutate_at(vars(amount, location.latitude, location.longitude), funs(as.numeric)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(location.latitude))
```
```{r}
water_data_df
```
```{r}
# create leaflet map
water_locations_map <- leaflet(water_data_df) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~location.longitude,
                   lat = ~location.latitude)
```
This piped command is equivalent the following sequence:

    water_locations_map <- leaflet(water_data_df)
    water_locations_map <- addTiles(water_locations_map)
    water_locations_map <- addCircleMarkers(water_locations_map, lng = ~location.longitude,
                            lat = ~location.latitude)
```{r}
water_locations_map
```
And now some customisation - popups on the markers with the station name, and a link to the historical data for that station.
```{r}
water_locations_map <- addCircleMarkers(water_locations_map, lng = ~location.longitude,
                            lat = ~location.latitude,
                            popup = ~paste0(station_name,
                                           "<br/>",
                                           "Discharge: ", amount,
                                            "<br/>",
                                           "<a href='", http_linkage.url ,"' target=_blank>", dwr_abbrev ,"</a>"
                                           )
                           )

water_locations_map
```
