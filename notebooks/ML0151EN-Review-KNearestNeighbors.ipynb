    "In this lesson, we are going to introduce the $K$-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm and show some practical ways of using it in `R` with the `knn` function that exists in the `class` library. Later, we will show how to tune it with the `caret` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a simple binary classification task (two class classification, $A$, $B$), *given* training and testing datasets and a positive integer $K$, for **each record in the test dataset**, KNN tries to find $K$ neighbors in **training set** that are *closest* to that test record and *counts* how many of those $K$ examples in the training set belong to class $A,$ and how many belong to class $B.$ The test record is then classified as belonging to the majority class (based on counted votes) i.e. the test record is considered to be of class $i$ if the majority of the $K$-nearest neighbors in the training set belong to class $i.$\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen, there are no parameters that *need to be learned during training* to determine whether a new observation belongs to class $A$ or $B.$ The only parameter used in k-nearest neighbors is k, which is a predetermined value. The algorithm simply works by looking at the training samples, calculating *distances* and finding the $K$ examples in the training set that are closest to the new observation. Thus, KNN is a *non-parametric,* supervised (needs training labels) learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram illustrates the main idea of how the k-nearest neighbors algorithm works. As $K$ varies from $3$ to $6$ the class of the new observation (red star) changes from $B$ to $A$ because the majority votes are changed. That is, for $K=3,$ we have two observations of class $B$ and one of class $A$, while for $K=6,$ we have two observations of class $B,$ and four of class $A.$\n",

    "\n",
    "For a regression task, the same method can be applied but instead of taking majority votes, we can, for example, find the mean of the $response$ $variable$ of the $K$-nearest neighbors from the new observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN depends on 1) the choice of metric (for example, Euclidean in above example), and 2) the choice of $K.$ There are no universal choices, and depending on the data, one has to examine various options to find a suitable choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Caveats:*\n",
    "\n",
    "* When using KNN, we must ensure that there are no categorical variables (factors) involved in the **features**, simply because one cannot find the distance from them. For example, when a categorical variable takes values from the set {apple, orange, banana, grapes ...}, one cannot make use of numerical distance functions, unless of course there is a pre-determined way to evaluate these distance from a qualitative standpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the training set is high-dimensional, KNN will suffer from [the curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality). Therefore, we could use a dimensionality reduction technique prior to using KNN.\n",

    "* *Standardize* the *training* set before using KNN. Precisely, one can preprocess data so that each training feature (column) has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Note that the order is exact. \n",
