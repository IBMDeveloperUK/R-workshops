The notebooks in this section provide an introduction to the basic syntax and capbilities of the R language, and the package ecosystem that supports it.

The Basics folder contains numerous exercises in individual Jupyter notebook format, as well as the equivalent R notebook format for use with RStudio.

All the basic exercises are combined into a single notebook `Lab-R_Combined` - we will use this to get familar with R.

In your Watson Studio instance, select or create a project, then use the `Add to project +` menu button and select `Notebook`.

Select the `From URL` option, and change the `Select runtime` to select **Default R 3.4 XS**.

Note that the 3.4 runtime is deprecated and will eventually be removed - in which case, select the R 3.6 (or later) option.
