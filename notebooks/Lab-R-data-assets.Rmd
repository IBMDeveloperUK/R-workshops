title: "R accessing project data assets Notebook"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

A key difference between the Jupyter notebook runtime, and the RStudio environment is the mechanism for accessing data assets defined to the project; for Jupyter notebooks, the data must be imported using the Cloud ObjectStore library (boto3, or similar), ut in RStudio, the objectore has been mapped to a directory off the home directory - _*project-storage*_. This makes for very simple data ingest. Note that the objects in this directory are, by default, *read-only*
```{r}
project_data_assets <- "~/project-objectstorage/"
```

```{r}
gosales_file = paste0(project_data_assets, "GoSales Transactions for Logistic Regression Model.csv")
gosales <- read.csv(gosales_file)
summary(gosales)
```
```{r}
names(gosales)
```
```{r}
max(gosales$AGE)
```
```{r}
min(gosales["AGE"])
```
```{r}
nrow(gosales)
```
[Logistic regression example](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/logit-regression/) shows how to run a regression against a set of features to predict a binary output (Yes/No, Up/Down, etc.)

Have a look at how you might apply the process to generate a predictor for the *IS_TENT* output.
