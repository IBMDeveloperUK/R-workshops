title: "R connecting to Db2 database Notebook"
output: html_notebook
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

There are a variety of methods published for using Db2 and RStudio -- watch out!  Many of the options relate to older implementations of the in-database analytics functions available when RStudio was included with DB2 Wahrehouse, and Netezza-based Analytics Applicance.

For the current implementation of RStudio in Watson Studio on IBM Cloud, to access data in the Db2 family of relational databases, install the [ibmdbR package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ibmdbR/index.html)
```{r}
install.packages("ibmdbR")
```
Now load the ibmdbR library, and the [DBI access library](https://db.rstudio.com/dbi/) to enable straightforward ability to load data from SQL queries.

```{r}
library("ibmdbR")
library("DBI")
```
Create your onw free SQL database with [Db2 on Cloud Lite Plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/db2).


Collect the SSLDSN property from your Db2 database credentials - in IBM Cloud, this is in the *Service Credentials* page from the Resource List view of your database. 
```{r}
db2dsn <- "DATABASE=BLUDB;HOSTNAME=db2w-iupkhrx.uk-south.db2w.cloud.ibm.com;PORT=50001;PROTOCOL=TCPIP;UID=bluadmin;PWD=somethingreallystrong;Security=SSL;"
```
The DBI library can use the standard ODBC services in combination with the ibmdbR-supplied driver to access Db2. Check out the DBI package information
```{r}
?`DBI-package`
```
Now use the DBI::dbConnect function to establish a connection - note the need to prepend the DSN string with the name of the required BLUDB odbc driver.
```{r}
db2 <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),paste('BLUDB;', db2dsn, ''))
```
Let's validate that we can retrieve data from the system catalog.
```{r}
dbListTables(db2,schema="SYSIBM")
```
And now load data into a dataframe from a specific table
```{r}
df <- dbGetQuery(con,'select * from SYSIBM.SYSTABLES')
```
Validate that dbQuery returns a dataframe
```{r}
class(df)
```
Sample some data
```{r}
head(df)
```
Retrieve and sort column data
```{r}
head(sort(df$NAME),10)
```
And, because R notebooks can do this - issue the database query directly from the SQL environment.
```{sql connection=db2, output.var=dfsql}
   SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSVIEWS
```
And see the output in the specified dataframe.
```{r}
dfsql
```
And close out the connection, when you're down
```{r}
dbDisconnect(db2) 
```
