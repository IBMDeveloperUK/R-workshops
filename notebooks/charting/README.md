# Charting with R

This lab is intended as a taster for the plotting and data visualisation services available in R

If you're familiar with *matplotlib* in the Python world, you should see great similarities.

This exercise will show simple plotting with the basic *plot()* functions, and equivalent (richer) plots using the *ggplot2* package which provide the *gglot()* functions.


This notebook [Lab-R-charting](Lab-R-charting.Rmd) is intended to be run in RStudio.
