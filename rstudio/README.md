## RStudio IDE

RStudio is an Open Source project built for creating R language scripts and applications.

RStudio is available for many platforms from [rstudio.com](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) - a free version for desktop, the rest are commercially packaged and supported.

RStudio is widely used and highly regarded in the data science and statistical communities, having been available since [2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RStudio).

IBM entered into a strategic partnership with RStudio (the company) to ensure RStudio is available through Watson Studio in its various implementations; of particular relevance is the ability to launch RStudio within a project.

Within a project, click on the `Launch IDE` menu button:
