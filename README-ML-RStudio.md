#Machine Learning with R in Watson Studio on IBM Cloud

This is a hands-on workshop with RStudio in IBM Cloud, exploring the basic of building supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. 
This will make use of the R language, 
and standard machine learning packages from the CRAN repository. 

A taster from the free Cognitive Class [Machine Learning with R course](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/machine-learning-r).

We take a look at some of the built-in and commonly-used datasets for building predictive models and classifiers.

Then a sample of the most commonly-used and respected library for quickly creating regressions, and neural networks; 
and then tackle hands-on labs with:

+ [DataExplorer](/notebooks/machine-learning/hello-DataExplorer.R)
+ [caret](/notebooks/machine-learning/hello-caret.Rmd)
+ [keras](/notebooks/machine-learning/hello-keras.Rmd)

The CognitiveClass course goes into way more detail (~12 hours) about the various methods for handling supervised and unsupervised learning, 
the tools and techniques for approaching modelling, and offers an open badge ![Acclaim ML with R](/res/ml-with-r-badge.png)
